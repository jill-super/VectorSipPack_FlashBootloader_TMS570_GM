SDOCM00086402 — Fapi_doMarginRead() does not read all requested data www.ti.com SDOCM00086402 Fapi_doMarginRead() does not read all requested data Severity S2 - Major Expected Behavior To read all data for the given range. Issue The function Fapi_doMarginRead() only returns 3/4 of the data requested on ECC regions. Conditions Using this function on ECC region will exhibit this behavior. Implications Wrong data or invalid reads may occur. Workaround(s) None 6 Hercules™ F021 Flash API SPNZ210 – July 2013 Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright © 2013, Texas Instruments Incorporated

Issue The example versions of the user defined functions Fapi_setupEepromSectorEnable() and Fapi_setupBankSectorEnable() does not show unlock the registers FSM_SECTOR/1/2. Conditions When trying to do an erase a bank after it has already been erased once after power on reset. Implications The bank will not erase. Workaround(s) As this is intended for the customer to modify, the unlock code can be added by them.

SDOCM00094147 — Incorrect read in Verify functions in ECC regions on LE devices www.ti.com SDOCM00094147 Incorrect read in Verify functions in ECC regions on LE devices Severity S2 - Major Expected Behavior Verification will work on ECC regions on Little Endian devices. Issue The read functions, Fapi_doVerify(), Fapi_doPsaVerify(), and Fapi_calculatePsa() will fail on Little Endian devices in the ECC regions do to a byte swap issue. Conditions When trying to use the functions Fapi_doVerify(), Fapi_doPsaVerify(), and Fapi_calculatePsa() on ECC regions on Little Endian devices. Implications This will cause false failures for Fapi_doVerify() and Fapi_doPsaVerify() and cause incorrect return value for Fapi_calculatePsa() on ECC regions on Little Endian devices. Workaround(s) For the function Fapi_doVerify(), use the byte variant Fapi_doVerifyByByte(). For the functions Fapi_doPsaVerify() and Fapi_calculatePsa(), none. 8 Hercules™ F021 Flash API SPNZ210 – July 2013 Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright © 2013, Texas Instruments Incorporated

Issue In this code segment in CGT.CCS.h, __TI_GNU_ATTRIBUTE_SUPPORT__ is missing the R: #if defined(__TI_GNU_ATTIBUTE_SUPPORT__) /* --gcc option enabled so we can specify this */ #define ATTRIBUTE_PACKED __attribute__((packed)) #else Conditions On CCS compilers, ATTRIBUTE_PACKED will always be an empty definition. Implications On builds expecting --gcc option to use attributes defined in code, enums will not be packed if the compile option to pack enums is not explicitly set. Workaround(s) Add the R to __TI_GNU_ATTIBUTE_SUPPORT__. 9SPNZ210 – July 2013 Hercules™ F021 Flash API Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright © 2013, Texas Instruments Incorporated

IMPORTANT NOTICE Texas Instruments Incorporated and its subsidiaries (TI) reserve the right to make corrections, enhancements, improvements and other changes to its semiconductor products and services per JESD46, latest issue, and to discontinue any product or service per JESD48, latest issue. Buyers should obtain the latest relevant information before placing orders and should verify that such information is current and complete. All semiconductor products (also referred to herein as “components”) are sold subject to TI’s terms and conditions of sale supplied at the time of order acknowledgment. TI warrants performance of its components to the specifications applicable at the time of sale, in accordance with the warranty in TI’s terms and conditions of sale of semiconductor products. Testing and other quality control techniques are used to the extent TI deems necessary to support this warranty. Except where mandated by applicable law, testing of all parameters of each component is not necessarily performed. TI assumes no liability for applications assistance or the design of Buyers’products. Buyers are responsible for their products and applications using TI components. To minimize the risks associated with Buyers’products and applications, Buyers should provide adequate design and operating safeguards. TI does not warrant or represent that any license, either express or implied, is granted under any patent right, copyright, mask work right, or other intellectual property right relating to any combination, machine, or process in which TI components or services are used. Information published by TI regarding third-party products or services does not constitute a license to use such products or services or a warranty or endorsement thereof. Use of such information may require a license from a third party under the patents or other intellectual property of the third party, or a license from TI under the patents or other intellectual property of TI. Reproduction of significant portions of TI information in TI data books or data sheets is permissible only if reproduction is without alteration and is accompanied by all associated warranties, conditions, limitations, and notices. TI is not responsible or liable for such altered documentation. Information of third parties may be subject to additional restrictions. Resale of TI components or services with statements different from or beyond the parameters stated by TI for that component or service voids all express and any implied warranties for the associated TI component or service and is an unfair and deceptive business practice. TI is not responsible or liable for any such statements. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for compliance with all legal, regulatory and safety-related requirements concerning its products, and any use of TI components in its applications, notwithstanding any applications-related information or support that may be provided by TI. Buyer represents and agrees that it has all the necessary expertise to create and implement safeguards which anticipate dangerous consequences of failures, monitor failures and their consequences, lessen the likelihood of failures that might cause harm and take appropriate remedial actions. Buyer will fully indemnify TI and its representatives against any damages arising out of the use of any TI components in safety-critical applications. In some cases, TI components may be promoted specifically to facilitate safety-related applications. With such components, TI’s goal is to help enable customers to design and create their own end-product solutions that meet applicable functional safety standards and requirements. Nonetheless, such components are subject to these terms. No TI components are authorized for use in FDA Class III (or similar life-critical medical equipment) unless authorized officers of the parties have executed a special agreement specifically governing such use. Only those TI components which TI has specifically designated as military grade or “enhanced plastic”are designed and intended for use in military/aerospace applications or environments. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that any military or aerospace use of TI components which have not been so designated is solely at the Buyer's risk, and that Buyer is solely responsible for compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements in connection with such use. TI has specifically designated certain components as meeting ISO/TS16949 requirements, mainly for automotive use. In any case of use of non-designated products, TI will not be responsible for any failure to meet ISO/TS16949.
